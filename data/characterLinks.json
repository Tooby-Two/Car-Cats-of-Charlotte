Since then, Bubba and Reddick have been the best of friends, doing almost everything together. In particular, both cats enjoy McDonalds, and often wear McDonalds merchandise."

When this was approved, Drennix took Reddick, who was just a kitten, and made Reddick his primary test subject. For 8 long years, Reddick was injected large amounts of energy inside his tiny body, irreversibly changing him and giving him lightning powers. Drennix oversaw these experiments, which would be dubbed 'The Beast Experiments'. One fateful day, an unknown assailant infiltrated the CGF, allowing Reddick to make his escape. Ever since, Drennix has sent out robotic cats to hunt down Reddick, as Reddick hides within the Charlotte woods."
