And now, he's my best bud. We do (almost) everything together... except for leaving the forest. I go and grab supplies in the nearby suburb, and he stays back home and keeps everything tidy. I feel bad for him, but it's for the best, unfortunately. It helps he's a big McDonalds fan too!",

Bubba, who was investigating the noises outside of his cabin, came across an unconcious Reddick and took him home. When Reddick woke, Bubba offered him shelter from Drennix. Since then, Bubba and Reddick have been the best of friends, doing almost everything together. In particular, both cats enjoy McDonalds, and often wear McDonalds merchandise."
