            "appearance": "<p>Reddick is a small four-legged cat. His main fur color is black, though it used to be reddish brown before the experiments. Reddick has a white muzzle, chest, and paws. He is also scarred all around his body, but primarily on his arms, chest, thighs, and head. His left eye sports a massive scar that extends out of his eyeball.</p>",

            "personality": "<p>Due to the experiments, Reddick is a very closed-off individual, who only keeps his best friend and caretaker Bubba close to him. He gets scared easily, often jumping at the slightest noise. However, Reddick has become very brave, taking after Bubba and his influence. Reddick loves to joke around with Bubba, and often the two play games outside of Bubba’s cabin. Reddick enjoys McDonalds, and loves to eat. He also loves sitting by the fire, under blankets, and under the stars at night. Although Reddick has lighting powers, he doesn’t like to use them very often, as they remind him of how different he is from other cats. Reddick doesn’t like thunderstorms for a similar reason.</p>",

            "backstory": "<p>When Reddick was just a kitten, he was taken by the Charlotte Government for experimentation. He was kept inside the Charlotte Government Facility (CGF) deep in the woods, and continuously experimented on by Drennix, the general overseeing the facility. Reddick, and the tests performed on him, were nicknamed 'Project: Beast'. The purpose of the tests was to attempt to recreate the supernatural energy that flowed naturally within the Were-Cats that populate Charlotte’s woods. Energy was forced into Reddick’s small body during the experiments, turning his once vibrant fur to an unnatural black, and ripping his skin open to reveal lightning green energy. </p><p>One day, an unknown assailant infiltrated the CGF, causing massive power outages and system failures. Reddick took the opportunity to escape, while being pursued by Drennix, and was able to evade capture using his lightning powers. The exhaustion finally got to Reddick as he was running through the Charlotte forest, and he passed out. Bubba, who was nearby, saw Reddick pass out, and took Reddick to his cabin in the woods. </p><p>When Reddick woke, Bubba introduced himself, and the two quickly became friends as Bubba offered hospitality and safety to Reddick.</p>",
