            "appearance": "<p>Reddick is a small four-legged cat. His main fur color is black, though it used to be reddish brown before the experiments. Reddick has a white muzzle, chest, and paws. He is also scarred all around his body, but primarily on his arms, chest, thighs, and head. His left eye sports a massive scar that extends out of his eyeball.</p>",

            "personality": "<p>Due to the experiments, Reddick is a very closed-off individual, who only keeps his best friend and caretaker Bubba close to him. He gets scared easily, often jumping at the slightest noise. However, Reddick has become very brave, taking after Bubba and his influence. Reddick loves to joke around with Bubba, and often the two play games outside of Bubba’s cabin. Reddick enjoys McDonalds, and loves to eat. He also loves sitting by the fire, under blankets, and under the stars at night. Although Reddick has lighting powers, he doesn’t like to use them very often, as they remind him of how different he is from other cats. Reddick doesn’t like thunderstorms for a similar reason.</p>",

            "backstory": "<p>When Reddick was just a kitten, he was taken by the Charlotte Government for experimentation. He was kept inside the Charlotte Government Facility (CGF) deep in the woods, and continuously experimented on by Drennix, the general overseeing the facility. Reddick, and the tests performed on him, were nicknamed 'Project: Beast'. The purpose of the tests was to attempt to recreate the supernatural energy that flowed naturally within the Were-Cats that populate Charlotte’s woods. Energy was forced into Reddick’s small body during the experiments, turning his once vibrant fur to an unnatural black, and ripping his skin open to reveal lightning green energy. </p><p>One day, an unknown assailant infiltrated the CGF, causing massive power outages and system failures. Reddick took the opportunity to escape, while being pursued by Drennix, and was able to evade capture using his lightning powers. The exhaustion finally got to Reddick as he was running through the Charlotte forest, and he passed out. Bubba, who was nearby, saw Reddick pass out, and took Reddick to his cabin in the woods. </p><p>When Reddick woke, Bubba introduced himself, and the two quickly became friends as Bubba offered hospitality and safety to Reddick.</p>",

And now, he's my best bud. We do (almost) everything together... except for leaving the forest. I go and grab supplies in the nearby suburb, and he stays back home and keeps everything tidy. I feel bad for him, but it's for the best, unfortunately. It helps he's a big McDonalds fan too!",

Bubba, who was investigating the noises outside of his cabin, came across an unconcious Reddick and took him home. When Reddick woke, Bubba offered him shelter from Drennix. Since then, Bubba and Reddick have been the best of friends, doing almost everything together. In particular, both cats enjoy McDonalds, and often wear McDonalds merchandise."

When this was approved, Drennix took Reddick, who was just a kitten, and made Reddick his primary test subject. For 8 long years, Reddick was injected large amounts of energy inside his tiny body, irreversibly changing him and giving him lightning powers. Drennix oversaw these experiments, which would be dubbed 'The Beast Experiments'. One fateful day, an unknown assailant infiltrated the CGF, allowing Reddick to make his escape. Ever since, Drennix has sent out robotic cats to hunt down Reddick, as Reddick hides within the Charlotte woods."
