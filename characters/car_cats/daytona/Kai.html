            "fullName":"Kyle 'Kai' Larson",
            "age": "Around 20",
            "pronouns": "He/Him",
            "species": "Car Cat",
            "role": "Professional Triathlete",

            "dislikes": "Being told to relax, Photos of himself, When others talk over each other",

            "appearance": "Kai is a Car Cat. His fur is primarily blue and white with orange accents. His paws are white and his shins are orange. He has a orange stripe down his back and on the top of his tail. He has dark brown eyebrows and hair. His fur around his eyes is colored orange naturally.",

            "personality":"Kai is, on the surface, a very egotistical, charismatic, and determined cat. His discipline is unmacthed, training relentlessly for every challenge that stands in his way. He loves competition and holds himself to impossible standards. Though confident, Kai never talks down to his competitors, instead staying humble and respectful, knowing how much work was put in to get to this point. He's always willing to offer advice or encouragement, along with a mix of boasting.</p><p>Beneath the intense drive to compete lies a lonely soul. Kai has never had close friends. He's told himself he doesn't need them, but deep down, there's a part of him that feels jealous when seeing others celebrate their wins with loved ones. His competitiveness had built a wall that shut everyone out of Kai's personal life.",

            "backstory":"Kai grew up in Daytona's big city, surrounded by culture and competition. From a young age, he was surrounded by the sights and sounds of ambition. He watched coastal marathons, swimming meets, and the legendary Daytona triathlons. He remembers standing on his father's shoulders, watching hundreds of cats pass by, feeling the roar of the crowd in his chest. This began the dream that he'd be the one racing one day soon.</p><p>In school, Kai was well-liked and socially respected, often surrounded by classmates drawn to his charisma and talent. He was the kind of student to be picked first in class- fast, dependable, and focused. Yet, despite his popularity, Kai never formed meaningful friendships. His conversations stayed light and casual, always smiling but never truly becoming close. He told himself that it was easier this way, that he needed to stay focused on his goals.</p><p>Kai's goal always remained clear. He wanted to race in a triathlon. The moment he was old enough to qualify, he signed up without hesitation. The first race changed everything. As he sprinted, swam, and biked his way past competitors, it became obvious to everyone that Kai wasn't just good. He was a prodigy. His blend of speed, stamina, and mental fortitude was unmatched by anybody.</p><p>From there, Kai's career took off. He quickly became the talk of the city, racking up podium after win after podium, his room filling with medals and trophies. Yet for Kai, it was never enough. He had to be faster, stronger, more resilient. He trained longer and harder, he changed his diet, he sought after the best coaching, and the results showed. He got better and better, but he firmly believed he hadn't reached the top.</p><p>This is when Kai began to feel the weight of loneliness. After every race, there was nobody waiting for him. He would just head back to his family, proud but quiet, and sit in his room surrounded by his achievements. He wanted someone, anyone, to talk to, to celebrate with, to share the highs and the lows of the sport with... usually, he'd be able to phase that feeling away with training, but it had been becoming increasingly difficult. </p><p>A fateful day on the beach sparked something, however. Kai pushed too hard training and crashed his bike, injuring his leg. The only help he got was a shy Aquatic Cat named Rheem. Rheem helped Kai back up, and the two sat on the beach and chat while Kai's leg healed. The two were almost perfect for each other right away, and Kai finally felt like somebody truly cared about him as a cat and not as a triathlete. After that, every day Kai trains on the beach Rheem is there to meet him. Kai eventually invites Rheem out to hang out more. As their friendship grows, Kai's feelings towards Rheem grow as well.",
