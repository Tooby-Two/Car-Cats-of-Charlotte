            "appearance": "Rheem is an Aquatic Cat. His fur is primarily black and white with red accents. He has a dorsal fin, gills, webbed paws, and a tail similar to that of a whale. His tail black on the top and white on the bottom. He also has a tuft of brown hair on his head. He wears a red sea shell around his neck at all times.",

            "personality": "Rheem is an introverted cat that prefers the solitude of the sea to the chatter of the streets. He loves swimming in the sea, lost in his thoughts and the currents of the ocean. Despite his love for solitude, Rheem does find a strange comfort in familiar public spaces, like coffee shops and resturaunts. It makes him feel like he belongs, even if he isn't directly talking with anybody. </p><p>Rheem doesn't have many friends. He's met plenty of other cats, whether that be through swimming in the ocean or meeting baristas in the local coffee shop, but those relationships never go past polite greetings. He feels a strong urge to connect more deeply, but his anxiety holds him back, fearing the possibility that he will say something wrong and make the situation worse. He tries his best to be kind in every interaction, often going out of his way to be courteous. He always says thank you and I'm sorry, sometimes too much, which makes his interactions feel stiff and overly formal.",

            "backstory": "Rheem has lived in the Seaside District in Daytona his whole life. His family moved from an Aquatic Cat town in the ocean to Daytona long ago. They came to Daytona to search for better opportunities and a life closer to land, while also giving their son the opportunity to thrive in a bigger city. </p> <p> Rheem grew up closely protected by his parents. He was taught at home instead of attending the public school in the Seaside District, out of fear that he would be picked on. Though they meant well, this caused Rheem to be unprepared for the bigger world. He lacked the tools to make friends, read social cues, or navigate unfamiliar situations. When Rheem grew older, he attempted to put himself out there and attend a college, but he was too nervous and dropped the idea before he even applied. </p><p>Now in his early 20s, Rheem still lives at home, quiety occupying a small guest room. His parents, while supportive, remain quietly worried, unsure how to help their son step into the world. Rheem spends his days swimming, exploring the Seaside District, and searching for a job that might suit somebody like him. </p><p>Rheem loves to swim in the oceans of Daytona next to the beaches, watching Car Cats and Aquatic Cats alike enjoy the scenery and peace. He also watches from afar as the triathlons of Daytona take place and as the triathletes train for them. On the beaches he watches, one particular cat catches his eye, the young phenom Kai. Rheem watched as Kai trains on the beaches of Daytona on his bike and dominates the triathlons when they are run. </p><p>One day, Kai crashes his bike on the beach, injuring his leg. With nobody around, Kai is unable to get up. Rheem decides to emerge from the waves to help Kai. They sit together on the beach for a bit, chatting about triathlons and the beautiful scenery. They hit it off really well, and after that, Rheem always made sure to say hello to Kai whenever Kai trains on the beach. They grew closer and closer, with Kai inviting Rheem to hang out more and Rheem swimming with Kai in the oceans. Eventually, Rheem develops romantic feelings for Kai, but is too afraid to say anything to Kai about it, out of fear that Kai doesn't reciprocate the feelings.",
