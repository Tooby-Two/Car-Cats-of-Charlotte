He's somebody that goes through life on a whim, going where the wind takes him, but has big plans for his future and wishes to be the best he can be. He often gets into arguments and fights with others who constantly cause trouble, but often comes out on the losing end. He's not at the top just yet, but he will be, just wait and see! ",
