            "age": "5",
            "pronouns": "He/Him",
            "species": "Car Cat",

            "appearance": "Creed is a Car Cat with primarily black fur with a white belly and tail. On his fur are jagged shapes of yellow, blue, and pink. His tail is fluffy, short, and primarily white, striped with color. His hair dangles down over his eyes, making it hard to see, but he prefers it that way. He has three tuffs of fur on his cheeks, also colored yellow, blue, and pink. He always wears blue and black glasses wherever he goes.",

            "personality": "Creed is a jack-of-all-trades in a world that demands specialization. He does well in school, plays video games, takes walks around nature, and participates in school sports, but he is not the best at any of those things. He is very friendly and loves to hang out with his classmates, but can never find a group of friends to call his own. He knows almost everyone and tries his best to be kind and approachable, but he is often seen as a loner. Because of this, Creed is often a target for bullies- kids who see his quiet nature, lack of close allies, and gentle personality as an easy target. Creed doesn't fight back against his bullies, believing that he doesn't have the strength to defend himself. The repeative bullying has hurt Creed inside, but he refuses to let it make him bitter. He continues to show kindness to others, even if they don't return it.",

            "backstory": "<p>Creed was born and raised in the suburbs of Charlotte. He went to school at a local public school, where he was bullied for being different. His primary bully was Heim, who would pick on Creed for his kind nature and lack of friends. Creed was often seen as a loner, and Heim would take advantage of that. Creed desperately tried to ignore the bullying, but it truly hurt him inside. He tried to make friends with his classmates, but they would often ignore him or bully him as well. </p><p>One day, Creed was taking a stroll around the city when he encountered Heim. Heim took the opportunity to physically bully Creed, shoving him to the ground and breaking his glasses. Finally pushed to his breaking point, Creed cowered in fear and started to cry, when suddenly Shane van Kitsburgen (SVK) appeared and stepped in between him and Heim. SVK told Heim to back off, scratching Heim's chest in the process, causing Heim to run away. Creed was shocked that somebody stood up for him, and was even more surprised when SVK offered to be his friend. Creed and SVK got along very well, especially since SVK was also a loner who had recently moved in from a far away place. Creed and SVK began to hang out more often. They would go on walks, play video games, and study together.</p><p>A few days after meeting SVK, Creed noticed a heightened police presence in Charlotte. He also saw new robotic cat police that he had never seen before. He was worried that something was going on, but he didn't know what. He asked SVK about it, but SVK didn't know either. Rumors circled about sounds coming from the forests West of Charlotte, and Creed's curiosity got the better of him. He and SVK decided to go into the woods to investigate the source of the sounds.</p>",
