            "appearance":"Gruff is a short and scruffy wolf. His main fur color is a greyish grown, with darker shades along his legs and back. His muzzle, chest, tummy, and paws are a bone white color, and his ears and hair are a darker shade of greyish brown. The tips of his ears are a reddish brown color, as well as some spots on his legs. Gruff's tail always droops downwards, with a striped pattern of bone white and reddish brown. The bridge of Gruff's nose is reddish brown.",

            "personality":"Gruff is the embodiment of unamused disdain, radiating an air of perpetual irritation. His ever-present frown and narrowed eyes give him a grumpy, scowling appearance that matches his bristly attitude. He never rushes, preferring to trudge with a slow, deliberate strut that screams, ''I’d rather be anywhere else.'' Gruff has little patience for others and keeps his circle of acquaintances to a bare minimum—friends are even rarer. Every minor inconvenience seems to set him off, grumbling like an old man yelling at kids to stay off his lawn. Despite his rudeness and sour outlook, there’s something oddly endearing about his cantankerous nature—if only anyone could get close enough to see it.",
